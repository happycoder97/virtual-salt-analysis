[Carbonate]
{Dil. HCl} is added to salt solution = Brisk effervescence. Colourless odourless gas evolved.
.. {gas} evolved is {pass}ed through {lime water} = Lime water turns milky.
{CH3COOPb} is added to the salt solution = White precipitate.
.. {dil. HCl} is added to the precipitate = Precipitate dissolves.

[Acetate]
Salt is {rub}bed with {dil. H2SO4} taken in a watch glass = Smell of vinegar is observed.
{Neutral FeCl3} is added to the salt solution = Solution turns to red colour.
Salt is mixed with {few ml} of {conc. H2SO4} and {alcohol} : The mixture is {heat}ed : Poured into {excess water} taken in a beaker = Fruity smell is evolved.

[Chloride]
Salt is {warm}ed with {few drops} of {conc. H2SO4} = A colourless fuming gas is evolved.
.. A {glass rod} {dip}ped in {NH4OH} is shown = Gas turns to white dense fumes.
Salt solution is acidified with {dil. HNO3} : Then {AgNO3} solution is added = White curdy precipitate is formed.
.. {Excess NH4OH} is added to the precipitate = Precipitate dissolves.
Salt is mixed with {conc. H2SO4} and {MnO2} = Greenish yellow gas with pungeant smell is evolved.

[Nitrate]
Salt is {heat}ed with {conc. H2SO4} : Then a {paper ball} is added = Reddish brown gas with irritating smell is evolved.
Salt solution is mixed well with {equal volume} of {freshly prepared} {FeSO4} solution : Then {conc. H2SO4} is added along the {side}s {without shaking} the test tube = Brown ring is formed between the layers.
Salt is treated with {diphenyl amine} : Then {conc. H2SO4} is added = Blue precipitate.

[Sulphate]
Salt solution is treated with {BaCl2} = White precipitate is formed.
.. {dil. HCl} is added to the precipitate = Precipitate does not dissolve.
{CH3COOPb} is added to the salt solution = White precipitate is formed.
.. The precipitate is mixed with {CH3COONH4} solution = Precipitate dissolves.
